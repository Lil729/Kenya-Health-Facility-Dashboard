# Kenya Health Facility Dashboard

📊 A real Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) dashboard based on Kenya health facility data across multiple counties. Built in Excel and Power BI — this project simulates the kind of work done by data or M&E analysts in NGOs and public health.

---

### 🎯 Project Objective

Track and visualize:
- Number of facilities per county
- Bed capacity distribution
- Facility type & size breakdown
- Distribution of large facilities across Kenya

### 📂 About the Data

The dataset contains 300+ health facilities in Kenya with columns like:
- `Facility Name`
- `Bed Capacity`
- `County`
- `Facility Type`
