# Kenya Health Facility Dashboard

📊 **Kenya Health Facility Dashboard (Public Health M&E Project)**  
A data dashboard analyzing health facility distribution and access in Kenya. Built for NGOs, public health orgs, and M&E teams to monitor service equity across counties.

---

### 🎯 Project Objective

To evaluate how health services are distributed across counties and sectors in Kenya. The dashboard answers:

- Are health facilities fairly distributed by region?
- Which counties have service gaps?
- How many are publicly vs privately owned?

---

### 📂 About the Data

The dataset includes public and private health facilities in Kenya, with columns such as:

- `Facility Name`
- `Facility Type`
- `Level`
- `Bed Capacity`
- `County`
- `Ownership`

An Excel formula was used to classify facilities into size groups (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, categorization)
- Microsoft Power BI (interactive dashboard, slicers, KPI visuals)

---

### 🔍 Key Insights

- 🏥 **Facility Density**: Nairobi has the highest number of facilities per square km, indicating urban bias.
- 🌍 **Unequal Access**: Northern and semi-arid counties are underserved.
- 🏛️ **Ownership Mix**: 60% of facilities are public; private facilities are concentrated in urban regions.
- 🛏️ **Infrastructure Disparity**: Bed capacity varies significantly by county and ownership type.
