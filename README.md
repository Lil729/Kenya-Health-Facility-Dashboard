### 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize:
- Number of health facilities by county
- Bed capacity distribution
- Facility size and type breakdown

### 📂 About the Data

The dataset includes 300+ health facilities in Kenya with key details like:
- Facility Type (e.g., Hospital, Clinic, Faith-based)
- Bed Capacity
